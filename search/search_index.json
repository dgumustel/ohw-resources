OHW21 is a 4-day collaborative learning experience taking place August 3-6, 2021, as a hybrid in-person and virtual event. It is aimed at exploring, creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking. At our general web site (https://oceanhackweek.github.io) you can read more about OceanHackWeek, including the OHW21 organizing committee and links to events from previous years . This site is being actively updated this week (week before OHW21)! Some parts are still out of date, and is the content from last year. We'll keep you posted about updates via Slack. In the meantime, please watch out for references to 2020 (\"OHW20\") or links that don't work. To make sure that OHW21 will be a welcoming environment for everyone, please read our Code of Conduct carefully as part of your preparation. We expect all participants to adhere to the Code of Conduct in all interactions throughout the hackweek. Schedules There are three different schedules, corresponding to the in-person event , the main virtual event and the Oceania virtual event . The \"Oceania\" virtual event is intended to accommodate participants from Australia to India. You will be asked to choose between the two virtual groups. Go to the Schedule page for details . Preparation We will use a JupyterHub -based online environment for all OceanHackWeek computational activities, including tutorials; this environment supports both Python and R. You will need a robust internet connection and a capable laptop or desktop computer. On July 29 and 30, we will offer short \"pre-hackweek\" optional sessions to answer questions on the basics of Git, GitHub, Jupyter and core R and Python scientific libraries, and OceanHackWeek in general. The schedule is available in the Schedule page , and the Zoom link will be sent via Slack. The content in the Preparation section will be updated very soon. We will use Slack, Zoom and GitHub as our primary communication and content delivery platforms.

The hackweek model has emerged in the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment. Compared to hackathons typically focused on software development, hackweeks have a greater focus on learning and open-ended projects as informal education and peer learning opportunities. This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery. This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative. The hackweek model adopted by OceanHackWeek was spearheaded by the successful Astro- , Neuro- , and Geohackweek . Mission Statement Core objectives The core objectives of OceanHackWeek are: Promote data and software proficiency in the ocean sciences community: Provide oceanographers with computational and data science skills to advance modern oceanographic research, which often requires the integration and manipulation of diverse sources of big data and models. Facilitate inclusive community building: Connect oceanographers across disciplines, career stages and trajectories, and diversity of experience and identity to cultivate an inclusive, open and sharing culture that catalyzes data-intensive research. Training and education We will share knowledge in modern software tools aimed at handling increasingly large and complex oceanographic datasets. Our approach will be to develop templates for best practices in solving common oceanographic data science challenges, built off a set of sample datasets provided during the hackathon. We will learn from leading experts in various fields, and use this knowledge to develop educational content that can be shared across disciplines long after the event. Our training will focus on software tools, but we will also explore challenges in successfully navigating complexity in project management and design. Networking and community building We will connect students, faculty, software developers and others across industry, government and academic settings. The connections we make during the hackathon will be maintained through an online user community. We hope our activities can foster the growth of an interdisciplinary network for solving Earth science challenges. Software development We will harness our collective talent assembled during the event to rapidly advance the development of software tools.","title":"About OHW"},{"location":"about_ohw/#about-oceanhackweek","text":"","title":"About OceanHackWeek"},{"location":"about_ohw/#what-is-a-hackweek","text":"The hackweek model has emerged in the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows.

Breaks will be announced every 3-hours and will last for 15-minutes, but of course you can stay longer. In fact, the space is yours to use for the entire hackweek for any purposes including meeting with your project team. The space is open starting now, July 30 until soon after OHW21 ends. We will be using the web-based platform from Wonder.me . The supported browsers are Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge, & Firefox works equally as well. Sometimes Linux has issues, but we have seen it work. You may need to fiddle to get the microphone or camera to work if you have multiple ones connected. It will not work on devices like ipads/smart phone/etc. Alas, not perfect, but kinda fun. When you click on the Wonder Room link you will be asked for permission to use your camera and microphone and to take a selfie with your computer to use for your avatar. Don\u2019t over think the picture, it\u2019s less scary walking up to someone with a picture vs initials. You will be dropped in the space where you can roam about freely between people/pods. As soon as your avatar is near another avatar, your audio/visuals will activate, and you will be able to see and hear only the people close by. It will deactivate when you move apart.

Breaks will be announced every 3-hours and will last for 15-minutes, but of course you can stay longer. In fact, the space is yours to use for the entire hackweek for any purposes including meeting with your project team. The space is open starting now, July 30 until soon after OHW21 ends. We will be using the web-based platform from Wonder.me . The supported browsers are Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge, & Firefox works equally as well. Sometimes Linux has issues, but we have seen it work. You may need to fiddle to get the microphone or camera to work if you have multiple ones connected. It will not work on devices like ipads/smart phone/etc. Alas, not perfect, but kinda fun. When you click on the Wonder Room link you will be asked for permission to use your camera and microphone and to take a selfie with your computer to use for your avatar. Don\u2019t over think the picture, it\u2019s less scary walking up to someone with a picture vs initials. You will be dropped in the space where you can roam about freely between people/pods. As soon as your avatar is near another avatar, your audio/visuals will activate, and you will be able to see and hear only the people close by. It will deactivate when you move apart.

Conda is an open source package and environment management system for any programming languages, but very popular among python community, The Hub is pre-configured with a customized \"environment\" of Python and R packages designed to run all the tutorial notebooks, and supporting a broad range of oceanographic applications. This environment is created and managed using the open-source Conda package and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages together with their dependencies, and convenient switching between environments. Conda runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux: \"Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.\" Conda may be used on your computer as well as the Hub ... https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw20-tutorials/blob/master/environment.yml For Python, the advantage of conda compared to pip is that it has a built in environment management system as well as the management of binaries, and non-Python dependencies. You do not need administrative or root permissions to install conda if you select a user-writable installation location. In the previous lesson we showed you a cloud-based environment for our work during the hackweek. What happens after the event when you want to go home and work with all the libraries we showed you? You will likely also want to have a functioning version of Python on your local laptop if that is not already in place. So this lesson takes you through our recommended procedure for doing that. We suggest you get this set up in advance so that we can help you troubleshoot when you arrive. Python Software Python software is distributed as a series of libraries that are called within your code to perform certain tasks. There are many different collections, or distributions of Python software. Generally you install a specific distribution of Python and then add additional libraries as you need them. There are also several different versions of Python. The two main versions right now are 2.7 and 3.7, although Python 2.7 will not be supported past 2020. Some libraries only work with specific versions of Python. So even though Python is one of the most adaptable, easy-to-use software systems, you can see there are still complexities to work out and potential challenges when delivering content to a large group. Therefore we have a number of different ways that we are trying to simplify this process to maximize your learning during the hackweek. We also provide instructions for using Anaconda , which is our recommended Python distribution, for installing and working with Python on your local computer. We can assist in setting up \"conda\" environments that will simplify the gathering of Python libraries and version specific to the tutorial you are working on. Installing Conda Miniconda If you don't have conda (either with Miniconda or the full Anaconda Distribution ) already installed we recommend installing Miniconda for latest Python 3 . https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html Windows Download the proper installer for your Windows platform (64 bits). When installing, you will be asked if you wish to make the Anaconda Python your default Python for Windows. If you do not have any other installation that is a good option. If you want to keep multiple versions of Python on your machine (e.g. ESRI-supplied python, or 64 bit versions of Anaconda), then don't select the option to modify your path or modify your Windows registry settings. Linux and OSX You may follow manual steps from here similar to the instructions on Windows (see above). Alternatively, you can execute these commands on a terminal shell (in this case, the bash shell): # For MacOSX url=https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh # For Linux url=https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh wget $url -O miniconda.sh bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda export PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH\" conda update conda --yes Installing Python We will be using Python 3.6 or 3.7 during the week (either will work). Since Anaconda (on Linux) expects you to work in the \"bash\" shell, if this is not already your default shell, you need to set it to be so (use the \"chsh -s /bin/bash\" command to change your default shell to bash) or just run an instance of bash from the command line before issuing \"Conda\" commands (/bin/bash or where it is located on your system). If you are already familiar with Python 2.7, you can take a look at the syntax differences here , but the main point to remember is to put the print statements in parentheses: print('Hello World!') $ conda create -n py37 python=3.7 To use Python 3.7: $ conda activate py37 To check if you have the correct version: $ python --version","title":"Conda and installing Python and R environments"},{"location":"prep/conda/#conda-and-installing-python-and-r-environments","text":"","title":"Conda and installing Python and R environments"},{"location":"prep/conda/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"prep/conda/#what-is-conda","text":"Conda is an open source package and environment management system for any programming languages, but very popular among python community, The Hub is pre-configured with a customized \"environment\" of Python and R packages designed to run all the tutorial notebooks, and supporting a broad range of oceanographic applications.

You are not required to be a Git pro in advance of this event, but come prepared to learn a lot about it! GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, enabling us to share code across teams in a web environment. We will use Git and GitHub for collaborative work. Be sure to arrive at OceanHackWeek with your own GitHub account. Git Installation Windows Install Git for Windows from this link . For more setup details follow these instructions Mac OS Download the git installer and run it. Linux (Debian): sudo apt install git-all To test, open the terminal (on Windows, Git Bash) and setup your username and email: git config --global user.name \"your username\" git config --global user.email \"your email\" Getting started with Bash terminal During the hackweek it will be useful to know how to navigate between files from the command line. If you are not familiar with the linux shell commands, you can review the first three sections of this Software Carpentry Shell Novice lesson. On Windows, use the Git Bash terminal to run these commands. Terminal (command line) text editor When working on the command line (the terminal or shell), it is often handy to modify file content directly from there. For that you can use a command line editor such as nano . On Mac and Linux it is usually pre-installed, but for Windows you can follow the instructions in this link to set it up. Test your installation by opening a terminal and running nano --version . If it works you can link your git configuration with nano : git config --global core.editor \"nano -w\" Git steps and workflows Centralized vs Fork-Clone workflows Steps 1-5 focus on the Git \"centralized workflow\". We present it here as an illustration, but the workflow we recommend for use in OceanHackWeek is the Git Fork - Clone workflow, discussed in Step 6. 1. Create a project repository On your own or someone in your project group (preferably one who has never done it before), create a repository for the project under the OceanHackWeek organization, https://github.com/oceanhackweek Click New and follow the steps: check yes to create a README.md file. Format project name as ohw21-proj-myprojectname (you can change the name later), where myprojectname is a brief name for your project Invite others to the repo: Settings -> Collaborators Note to collaborators: you will receive an invitation to your email associated with github.com. If you cannnot find it look for the bell notifications on the top right of the website. 2. Clone the repository Each participant should clone the repository so they have their copy on their JupyterHub account space (and locally in the participant's computer, if desired). Navigate through the terminal to the folder where you want to keep OceanHackWeek work ( cd path_to_oceanhackweek ). git clone https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw21-proj-myprojectname.git This will create a new folder called ohw21-proj-myprojectname . Navigate to the new folder, ohw21-proj-myprojectname . 3. Update the README with your name Open the README.md file with your favorite editor and create a new section header. Under this section add your name. Then add this change, commit it to the local repository, and push it so that it appears on the origin GitHub repository. git add README.md git commit -m \"Adding new name to README.md\" git push origin Make sure your change appears online. Remember to run: git status to observe the changes made into your repository. Pay attention to the colors. To see the changes in the files run git diff . 4. Update your local repository (local clone) with the changes of your collaborators git pull origin master Remember origin is just a short name of the web address of the repository. To see what is hidden in origin: git remote -v To continue practicing these steps, make more changes to the title and the description of the project. Ran into a problem? When working with several people sometimes you cannot push because changes have been made that have not been incorporated: need to first pull when pulling you arrive into a merge conflict: need to resolve the conflict manually 5. Resolving the merge conflict git status You will see the file/s which caused the merge conflict in green. Open it and detect the conflict by the special format: <<<<<<< HEAD my text ======= somebody else's text >>>>>>> 35ab35436 Decide which changes you want to keep, and modify the file so it looks as you wish directly from the editor. Remove the unnecessary characters. Add, commit and push the changes. git add README.md git commit -m \"resolving merge conflict\" git push origin master You can continue working on as usual. Remember to pull often and push small changes ... ... to avoid messing with complicated merges and keep your repo up-to-date. 6. Avoiding problems: forking workflow So far you collaborated using what is called a \"centralized git workflow\": i.e. every collaborator makes directly changes to the repo. Some merge conflicts can be avoided by working with forks (using a \"forking git workflow) instead of directly pushing to the repo. Forking Git Workflow This is the workflow covered in the OHW20 pre-hackweek presentation on 2020-8-6. The presentation pdf is here , and the recording is here ; the workflow is the one recommended for use in OHW21. Here's an excellent guide to the Forking Git Workflow: Step-by-step guide to contributing on GitHub Forks are public copies of the main repo, from which you can submit changes to the main repo. Sync your local repo with the public one Fork the public repo (click on the Fork button) Note it looks the same but the web address contains your username https://github.com/myghusername/ohw21-proj-ProjectName Go to your local repo and rename your origin to point to the fork: git remote rm origin git remote add origin https://github.com/myghusername/ohw21-proj-ProjectName.git Add a new remote to talk to the main repo: git remote add upstream https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw21-proj-ProjectName.git From now on you will push to origin , but pull from upstream . Warning Make sure your origin contains your github username, and upstream contains the oceanhackweek name. Submitting changes via a pull request Make some changes to a file and commit and publish them. git add README.md git commit -m \"more changes\" git push origin master Note They appear on your fork, but not on the main repo. Submit a pull request by clicking New pull request : Explain what changes you have made. Assign somebody for review. Reviewer: look through changes in the files Approve PR or ask for more changes. Note While your pull request is pending, any change you push to the fork will become a part of the request. This is useful if you are asked to make small changes before your PR is accepted. In general we encourage github users to submit changes to the main repo through pull requests, but direct push is still a viable workflow for small projects when participants work on the same documents. Troubleshooting Deleting files git rm filename.txt rm filename.txt Note git rm just removes the file from git, to delete the file completely use the bash rm command after that. Reverting to the previous commit git revert HEAD Note Your files in the local repo will still be there.

This ecosystem is described succinctly and effectively in the online open book, Teaching and Learning with Jupyter : Project Jupyter is three things: a collection of standards, a community, and a set of software tools. Jupyter Notebook, one part of Jupyter, is software that creates a Jupyter notebook. A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports mixing executable code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Specifically, Jupyter notebooks allow the user to bring together data, code, and prose, to tell an interactive, computational story. ( \"2.2 But first, what is Jupyter Notebook?\" ) We will use the JupyterLab software to create, manage and run Jupyter notebooks. You will be exposed to Jupyter notebooks throughout the hackweek, including in most tutorials. To learn more about Jupyter, Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab: Check out several sections in the Teaching and Learning with Jupyter online open book, specially Chapter 5 Jupyter Notebook ecosystem . See the OceanHackWeek 2020 pre-hackweek tutorial \"Jupyter and Scientific Python basics: numpy, pandas, matplotlib\", which demonstrates effective Jupyter use both on your computer (\"locally\") and on JupyterHub: Jupyter notebooks \u2014 tutorial video . The video includes Q&As at the end where you'll find common questions you may find asking yourself. See the resources at the end of this page . Why are we using a shared cloud computing environment? Teaching software to a diverse group of participants, each with different computers and operating systems, can be challenging. There are specific ways to configure our software for the tutorials to be successful, so it takes time to get everyone set up consistently. Our solution to this is to give everyone access to a cloud computing environment that is pre-configured for the specific software we will deploy. This cloud computing instance can be accessed from any web browser, which eliminates the need for configuring each person's individual computer. For this hackweek we have created virtual computing instances that can be deployed on demand in a parallel computing environment. We use JupyterHub as a way to give a Jupyter Notebook server ( JupyterLab ) to each person in a group. These (slightly old) slides give a nice overview of what JupyterHub is all about. JupyterHub enables us to quickly begin working with code without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on everyone's individual computers. We encourage you to use our shared JupyterHub resources for running all the tutorials and for your projects. We also hope you will practice installing Python libraries locally on your laptop so that you can continue working after leaving our event. How do I access the shared cloud environment? Access to our shared cloud environment is easy. Just click on https://ohw.pilot.2i2c.cloud You can now click on the \"Log in to continue\" button, then on the next screen click on \"Sign in with GitHub\" to grant JupyterHub the required permissions. In the next window, enter your GitHub username (or email address) and password. You will then see something like this while the JupyterHub OceanHackWeek 2021 server environment is loading: It will take a bit of time for this to load - be patient! Once things are spun up you will see your very own instance of a JupyterLab graphical user interface: How do I get my code in and out of JupyterHub? When you start your own instance of JupyterHub you will have access to your own virtual drive space. No other JupyterHub users will be able to see or access your data files. Next we will explain how you can upload files to your virtual drive space and how to save files from JupyterHub back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive. First we'll show you how to pull some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of most tutorials we'll ask you to \"clone\" (make a copy of) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your JupyterHub drive space. To do this, we will need to interface with the JupyterHub file system. JupyterHub is deployed in a Linux operating system and we will need to open a terminal within the JupyterHub JupyterLab interface to manage our files. There are two ways to do this: (1) Navigate to the \"File\" menu, choose \"New\" and then \"Terminal\" or (2) click on the \"terminal\" button in JupyterLab: This will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface: You can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system. Now let's clone a repository (see the Git Setup and Basics page). We'll illustrate this with the ohw-tutorials repository. First, navigate in a browser on your own computer to the repository link https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials . Next, click on the green \"Code\" button and then copy the url into your clipboard by clicking the copy button (clipboard icon): Now navigate back to your command line in JupyterLab. Type git clone and then paste in the url: git clone https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials.git After issuing the git clone command you should see something like this (again, the screenshot below is for a different repo, but the concept is identical): End your Hub session every day. Will I lose all of my work? When you are finished working for the day or for an extended period of time, it is important to explicitly shutdown your JupyterHub session, to reduce the load on our cloud infrastructure and overall costs. To shutdown your server , if you are viewing JupyterLab, you access the control via File > Hub Control Panel menu item: Then you can shutdown your server from your hub control panel (which you can also access directly from https://ohw.pilot.2i2c.cloud/hub/home ): Note that the menu item File > Log Out doesn't actually shut down the server, so please follow these steps instead. Warning Shutting down (Stop Server) will NOT cause any of your work to be lost or deleted. It simply shuts down some resources. It would be equivalent to turning off your desktop computer at the end of the day. References and Resources Why Jupyter is data scientists\u2019 computational notebook of choice.

No other JupyterHub users will be able to see or access your data files. Next we will explain how you can upload files to your virtual drive space and how to save files from JupyterHub back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive. First we'll show you how to pull some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of most tutorials we'll ask you to \"clone\" (make a copy of) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your JupyterHub drive space. To do this, we will need to interface with the JupyterHub file system. JupyterHub is deployed in a Linux operating system and we will need to open a terminal within the JupyterHub JupyterLab interface to manage our files. There are two ways to do this: (1) Navigate to the \"File\" menu, choose \"New\" and then \"Terminal\" or (2) click on the \"terminal\" button in JupyterLab: This will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface: You can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system. Now let's clone a repository (see the Git Setup and Basics page). We'll illustrate this with the ohw-tutorials repository. First, navigate in a browser on your own computer to the repository link https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials . Next, click on the green \"Code\" button and then copy the url into your clipboard by clicking the copy button (clipboard icon): Now navigate back to your command line in JupyterLab. Type git clone and then paste in the url: git clone https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials.git After issuing the git clone command you should see something like this (again, the screenshot below is for a different repo, but the concept is identical):","title":"How do I get my code in and out of JupyterHub?"},{"location":"prep/jupyterhub/#end-your-hub-session-every-day-will-i-lose-all-of-my-work","text":"When you are finished working for the day or for an extended period of time, it is important to explicitly shutdown your JupyterHub session, to reduce the load on our cloud infrastructure and overall costs.

There are many different collections, or distributions of Python software. Generally you install a specific distribution of Python and then add additional libraries as you need them. There are also several different versions of Python. The two main versions right now are 2.7 and 3.7. During the hackweek we will be using Python 3.7 for the tutorials, and encouraging participants to do so. If you have only used Python 2 in the past check out the key differences here . Even though Python is one of the most adaptable, easy-to-use software systems, you can see there are still complexities to work out and potential challenges when delivering content to a large group. Therefore we have a number of different ways that we are trying to simplify this process to maximize your learning during Oceanhackweek. We will be using Ocean Pangeo ( http://ocean.pangeo.io ), which is a platform for using Jupyter Notebooks in the ocean, atmospheric, and climate research community. A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and markdown texts. Setting up Python locally Although, you we will provide you with a Python working environment, it will be good if you set up Python locally on your laptop: you might need it for some of your project work, Python review, or for future Python development. We recommend installing the Miniconda Python distribution. We can assist in setting up \"conda\" environments that will simplify the gathering of Python libraries and version specific to the tutorial you are working on. Conda is an open source package and environment management system for python libraries . We will be using various Python libraries with multiple dependencies, so it is critical that you have some sort of package management system in place. Conda can be installed in almost any computer. The advantage of conda compared to pip is that it has a built in environment management system as well as the management of binaries, and non-python dependencies. Here are the system requirements: 32-bit or 64-bit computer. Minimum 400 MB disk space to download and install. Windows Vista or newer, OS X 10.7+, or Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat and others; CentOS 5+) NOTE: You do not need administrative or root permissions to install conda if you select a user-writable install location. To test your installation you can run python in the terminal and check if the version you have is Miniconda Python 3. Let us know if on Slack you are having problems with installing Conda. Brushing up on Python Given all the heavy use of Python during Oceanhackweek, we will not be able to provide instruction in Python fundamentals. We expect you to have basic Python familiarity on the level of manipulating variables (lists, arrays), writing loops/functions, making simple plots. If you have not used Python before or it has been a while since you have used it, please, go thouroughly through the lesson below Software Carpentry Python Tutorial (1 day workshop with exercises) Notebook environment The more, the better!

Pre-Hackweek tutorials Git and GitHub, including the Git fork - clone \"workflow\". Presentation slides (pdf) \u2014 video Jupyter and Scientific Python basics: numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Jupyter notebooks \u2014 video Start the Hub in your browser Step 1 Navigate to the OceanHackWeek Hub, https://ocean.hackweek.io/ . Step 2 Sign in using your GitHub account, if you are not already signed in. (First time only: Grant the OceanHackWeek Organization permissions - this grants you access to the cloud computing environment for the Hackweek.) Step 3 Start the \"Oceanhackweek\" computing environement (the Oceanhackweek \"image\"). It may take up to a minute or so to start up. Upload ( git clone ) a copy of the oh20-tutorials GitHub repository and follow along This basic workflow allows you to follow along with tutorials with your own live copy of the tutorials notebooks while staying up-to-date with any changes made to the master tutorials repository, ohw20-tutorials . Shortcut The first time you try to upload ( git clone ) the ohw20-tutorials repository, launch a new terminal, then enter: git clone https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw20-tutorials.git Now you have a new ohw20-tutorials directory under your \"home\" directory, /home/jovyan . You're good to go! Longer description - Step 1 Navigate to the tutorial repository on GitHub . Clone the tutorial to the Hub environment. You can easily copy the link to a repository by selecting the green \"clone or download\" dropdown (making sure the pop up says \"Clone with HTTPS\") and hitting the clipboard icon, which will automatically copy the link for you. Launch a terminal using the \"plus\" sign in the upper left corner of your JupyterHub: then execute the git clone statement: git clone https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw20-tutorials.git A new ohw20-tutorials directory will be created, holding the repository clone. Step 2 Follow along by opening and running the tutorial notebooks. You can save changes within your clone (such as edits to a notebook) or add other files, then download a copy to your local machine if you'd like. Step 3 Update your Hub copy with any changes to the origin repository. If you have saved changes within your local copy of the notebook or added other files, this may cause conflicts ( ask us questions if you run into problems! ). Fetch and merge (using git pull ) the latest changes from the origin remote. git pull origin These instructions assume you're working on the default master branch. Please note: the OceanHackWeek JupyterHub (the Hub) should not be relied upon to save your files beyond the duration of the hackweek, and will be removed a couple of weeks after the hackweek. Thus, for any non-repository changes or repository changes that have not been pushed to GitHub, you MUST complete Step 3 to save the files to your local machine if you would like continued access to them.
